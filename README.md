# React Learning Projects

A growing collection of React mini-apps built during my continuous learning journey. Each project focuses on practicing specific React concepts and patterns through hands-on development.

> 🌱 **This repository is actively growing!** As I continue learning React, I'll be adding more mini-apps to practice new concepts and solidify my understanding.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React (via Vite)** - Modern React development environment with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)  
- **HTML5** - Structure  
- **CSS3** - Styling (global `styles.css` for consistent look and feel)  
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Core functionality  
- **Vite** - Development server and build tool

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dr3amcoder/my-mini-apps.git
   cd my-mini-apps
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ``` bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the browser at the URL provided by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).


## 📚 Learning Approach

This repository represents my ongoing journey to master React through practical application. Each mini-app is built using different learning methods:

- **Online courses** (FreeCodeCamp, tutorials)
- **AI-assisted learning** (ChatGPT guidance)
- **Documentation deep-dives**
- **Hands-on experimentation**

As I progress, I'll continue adding new projects that explore more advanced React patterns and concepts.

## 📝 Key React Concepts Practiced

- State management with `useState`
- Side effects with `useEffect`
- Ref handling with `useRef`
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Component composition
- Project structure and modularization
- Integrating global styles with CSS
- Forms in React - Understanding form handling and the `useActionState` hook
- Data Fetching & Memoization - Optimizing data retrieval and performance

## 🎯 What's Next?

Based on my FreeCodeCamp curriculum, upcoming topics include:

- **Routing & React Frameworks** - Navigation and framework tools
- **Debugging Strategies** - Best practices for troubleshooting React apps
- **Performance Optimization** - Techniques to improve app speed
- **Testing** - Writing tests for React components
- **CSS Libraries & Frameworks** - Modern styling approaches
- **Data Visualization with D3** - Creating interactive charts and graphs
- **TypeScript Fundamentals** - Adding type safety to React projects
