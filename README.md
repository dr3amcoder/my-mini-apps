# React Learning Projects

A growing collection of React mini-apps built during my continuous learning journey. Each project focuses on practicing specific React concepts and patterns through hands-on development.

> 🌱 **This repository is actively growing!** As I continue learning React, I'll be adding more mini-apps to practice new concepts and solidify my understanding.

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://dr3amcoder.github.io/OTPGenerator/)**

## 📋 Current Projects

### OTP Generator 📱

- Generates secure 6-digit one-time passwords
- 5-second countdown timer with auto-expiration
- Visual feedback on OTP status
- Button disabled during countdown to prevent spam

### Character Counter ✍️

- Real-time character counting
- Input validation with visual warnings
- Displays warning message when character count exceeds 20

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** (via CDN) - UI library with hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Styling
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Core functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dr3amcoder/OTPGenerator.git
   cd OTPGenerator
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   Or use a local server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Or using Node.js
   npx serve
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port)

## 📚 Learning Approach

This repository represents my ongoing journey to master React through practical application. Each mini-app is built using different learning methods:

- **Online courses** (FreeCodeCamp, tutorials)
- **AI-assisted learning** (ChatGPT guidance)
- **Documentation deep-dives**
- **Hands-on experimentation**

As I progress, I'll continue adding new projects that explore more advanced React patterns and concepts.

## 📝 Key React Concepts Practiced

- State management with `useState`
- Side effects with `useEffect`
- Ref handling with `useRef`
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Component composition

## 🎯 What's Next?

Based on my FreeCodeCamp curriculum, upcoming topics include:

- **Forms in React** - Understanding form handling and the `useActionState` hook
- **Data Fetching & Memoization** - Optimizing data retrieval and performance
- **Routing & React Frameworks** - Navigation and framework tools
- **Debugging Strategies** - Best practices for troubleshooting React apps
- **Performance Optimization** - Techniques to improve app speed
- **Testing** - Writing tests for React components
- **CSS Libraries & Frameworks** - Modern styling approaches
- **Data Visualization with D3** - Creating interactive charts and graphs
- **TypeScript Fundamentals** - Adding type safety to React projects
